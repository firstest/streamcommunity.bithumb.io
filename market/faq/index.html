<p><a name="howtosell"></a></p>

<h3>How do I put an item up for sale?</h3>

<p>Eligible items can be either be sold from the Community Market home page or from within your item inventory.</p>

<p><a name="howtobuy"></a></p>

<h3>How do I buy an item?</h3>

<p>Clicking the &quot;Buy now&quot; button on any listing will start the purchase process. Please note that all purchases are final.</p>

<p><a name="removelisting"></a></p>

<h3>How do I remove a listing?</h3>

<p>All of your current listings are shown at the top of the Community Market home page. Any listing can be canceled/removed before it is purchased by clicking the &quot;Remove&quot; button.</p>

<p><a name="walletfunds"></a></p>

<h3>How do I add funds to my Steam Wallet?</h3>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1122-RTSC-0478">Wallet Funds FAQ</a>. Steam Wallet Funds can be added from your <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/steamaccount/addfunds" title="Add Wallet Funds">Account Details page</a> in the Steam Store.</p>

<p><a name="refund"></a></p>

<h3>How can I reverse or cancel a completed Community Market transaction and/or get a refund?</h3>

<p>All purchases are final &ndash; you will not have any right to a refund or a reversal of any Community Market transaction once it is completed.</p>

<p><a name="eligibleparticipants"></a></p>

<h3>Who is eligible to participate in the Community Market?</h3>

<p>The account must have a successful purchase older than 30 days, but not older than a year. Additionally, Steam Guard must be enabled for 15 days. Please note, redeeming a Steam gift does not grant access to the Community Market.</p>

<p>For a complete list of Market restrictions and requirements to use The Community Market, please view our <a href="kb_article.php?ref=1047-EDFM-2932">Market and Trade Restrictions FAQ</a> and our <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=3330-IAGK-7663">Limited User Account FAQ</a>.</p>

<p><a name="allitems"></a></p>

<h3>Why don't I see all of my items when I try to sell something?</h3>

<p>When selecting an item to sell on the Community Market, only items that are eligible to be sold will be visible. Steam Support is unable to modify items in your inventory to allow them to be sold on the Community Market.</p>

<p><a name="currency"></a></p>

<h3>How are cross-currency transactions handled in the Community Market?</h3>

<p>Sellers will always list items for sale in the native currency of their Steam Wallet, and buyers will always see Community Market prices expressed in the native currency of their Steam Wallet. For items listed for sale in a different currency than the buyer's Steam Wallet currency, we apply an exchange rate which we update daily. You must be signed into your Steam account to view the correct currency. If you do not see your local currency on the Community Market this is likely due to never funding your Steam Wallet on the account. You can find out more on how to fund your Steam Wallet by visiting the <a href="kb_article.php?ref=1122-RTSC-0478" title="Wallet FAQ">Steam Wallet FAQ</a>.</p>

<p><a name="viewtransactions"></a></p>

<h3>Where can I see my Community Market transactions?</h3>

<p>Your Community Market history is accessible from the top of the Community Market home page, as well as from your Account Details page in the Steam Store. A receipt for each transaction will also be emailed to you.</p>

<div class="category"><span>Restrictions</span></div>

<p><a name="restrictions"></a></p>

<h3>What kind of Steam Wallet and item listing restrictions apply?</h3>

<p>Currently we are restricting Steam Wallet balances to $2000. In other currencies, the limit will be set to a value close to $2000. We also limit the maximum price of a single listing on the market to $1800 (or similar for other currencies). You will be restricted from listing items for sale in the Community Market if the existing balance in your Steam Wallet, plus the sale price of the item(s), would together exceed the $2000 limit. We may be adjusting the Steam Wallet balance limit, or otherwise changing this restriction, in the future. Note that, if you have multiple accounts, balances for all Steam Wallets associated with all of your accounts will be aggregated for purposes of applying this limit.</p>

<p><a name="prices"></a></p>

<h3>Are there minimum or maximum sales prices for items in the Community Market?</h3>

<p>Currently there is no minimum sales price, although we may decide to impose a minimum price in the future. Currently, the maximum price for any particular item is $1800.</p>

<p><a name="steamguard"></a></p>

<h3>Why is Steam Guard required?</h3>

<p>We require Steam Guard to be enabled for 15 days to help protect your items and Steam Wallet funds from being misused by somebody who may have illicitly obtained your account.</p>

<p><a name="withdrawfunds"></a></p>

<h3>Can I withdraw or transfer funds from my Community Market sales/transactions?</h3>

<p>No. All Community Market sales and purchases are completed using the Steam Wallet. The funds cannot be withdrawn or transferred to another Steam account or to a bank/3rd party account. You may use the funds to purchase Steam gifts to send to other users.</p>

<p><a name="eligibleitems"></a></p>

<h3>Why are some of my items not eligible?</h3>

<p>Newly purchased Dota 2 treasures can’t be sold on the Community Market for the set amount of time noted on their store page. Items gained as timed drops from Dota 2 are permanently not marketable. Some 3rd party games items might not be marketable after purchase. You can select the item in your Steam inventory and read its description to see when it can be marketable.</p>

<p><a name="limited"></a></p>

<h3>Why aren't all games on the Community Market?</h3>

<p>It is up to the game developer to decide whether or not they want to participate in the Community Market.</p>

<p><a name="whererestrictions"></a></p>

<h3>Where can I see all of the restrictions that can block me from using the Community Market?</h3>

<div class="category"><span>Fees</span></div>

<p><a name="steamfee"></a></p>

<div class="category"><span>Taxes and 200 Item Sale Limit</span></div>

<p><a id="whyforms" name="whyformsnow"></a></p>

<h3>Why am I being asked to provide tax information?</h3>

<p>The United States Internal Revenue Service, under Section 6050W of the Internal Revenue Code, requires us to collect certain information from you if you engage in more than 200 separate sales transactions in a calendar year. In particular, if you are a U.S. citizen or resident, you will need to provide us with your name, address and Social Security Number, and if you are not a U.S. citizen or resident, you will need to provide evidence of your non-U.S. status on an online form we provide to you. We will be providing a link to these forms and a process by which you can provide the needed information if and as you approach the 200 sales limit. We may use a third-party to collect this information. You can choose not to provide this information if you wish, but you will not be able to list any items for sale in the Community Market once you meet the 200 sales threshold, and any items listed will be removed. Note that, while we are required to collect this information from you, we are not required to share this information with the IRS under Section 6050W unless you exceed $20,000 in gross sales in the Community Market within a single calendar year. For purposes of calculating the number of sales you have made in a calendar year, all of your accounts will be treated as a single account.</p>

<p><a id="addldocsemail" name="addldocsemail"></a></p>

<h3>Why did I get an email notifying me that I need to provide additional documentation?</h3>

<p>For non-U.S. citizens, in cases where you previously provided us with a U.S. address, we may be required to collect additional documentation from you to validate your non-U.S. status. Valve uses a third-party validation service (currently, <a href="http://www.cticompliance.com/">Compliance Technologies International (CTI)</a>) to receive and validate this additional documentation. The third party will not be permitted to use any information collected from you for any purpose other than validation of your documentation for Valve, and will be contractually obligated to keep any information you provide confidential and secure.</p>

<p><a id="providing1099s" name="providing1099s"></a></p>

<h3>Will you be providing 1099&rsquo;s based on my transactions in the Community Market?</h3>

<p>The United States Internal Revenue Service requires us to report gross sales for, and provide IRS Form 1099&rsquo;s to, only those subscribers who are U.S. citizens or residents and who exceed 200 sales transactions in a calendar year and also exceed $20,000 in gross sales proceeds from those sales transactions in that same calendar year, from all of the subscriber's accounts. If you are a U.S. citizen or resident and exceed both of these thresholds, we will report the amount of gross sales to the IRS and provide you with Form 1099.</p>

<p><a name="incometaxes"></a></p>

<h3>Do I have to pay income taxes on the proceeds of sales I make in the Community Market?</h3>

<p>Different countries have different rules relating to the taxation of digital transaction. For U.S. citizens and residents, as discussed above, we are obligated to collect certain taxpayer identifying information from those who engage in more than 200 transactions in a calendar year, but no information is reported to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service unless your gross revenues from such sales exceed $20,000. Ultimately, the responsibility for determining any income tax liabilities, which you may or may not have, rests with you. If you are concerned about your liability, you should consult a tax advisor.</p>

<p><a name="whyformsnow"></a></p>

<h3>Why do I have to provide additional documentation if I haven't reached 200 market sales?</h3>

<p>We request this information early on so that you have time to fill it out accurately. Validation by the third party can take time, if you hit the 200 limit without the form validated you will not be able to sell additional items until validation is complete.</p>

<p><a name="noforms"></a></p>

<h3>What if I choose not to provide or fill out the additional documentation?</h3>

<p>You are not required to provide the additional documentation, however if you do not provide this information and reach 200 Market sales you will not be able to list additional items. You will still be able to purchase items from the Community Market as this form does not affect buying on the market.</p>

<p><a name="VATtaxes"></a></p>

<h3>Do I have any obligation to collect or pay sales, VAT, or other transaction taxes based on transactions I engage in in the Community Market?</h3>

<p>Different countries have different rules relating to the taxation of digital transactions. Most jurisdictions do not require individuals to register for, collect or pay sales, VAT or use taxes in connection with occasional sales where they do not qualify as &quot;professional&quot; sellers. However, the ultimate responsibility for determining any tax requirements that may apply to sales you make in the Community Market rests with you, and so if you are concerned about the issue you should consult your own tax advisor. Note that, with respect to our administrative fee, if any sales, VAT, or other taxes are due on that payment, we will be responsible for paying those taxes.</p>

<div class="category"><span>Buy Orders</span></div>

<p><a name="commodity"></a></p>

<h3>What is a commodity item?</h3>

<p>A commodity is a kind of item where all the items are identical, and can be traded interchangeably. There aren't individual listings for commodity items on the market; instead you place an order to purchase, and an item is selected for you. This is very helpful when trying to buy items that are very frequently traded, and item listings can appear and disappear very quickly.</p>

<p><a name="buyorder"></a></p>

<h3>What is a buy order?</h3>

<p>When buying a commodity items, you specify the price you want to pay, and when an item comes available at that price the purchase completes. If there isn't an item available immediately at that price, then that request to purchase stays active until an item listed at the right price comes along. This request to purchase is called a buy order. The buy order price is the maximum amount that will be spent; if an item comes along for a cheaper price, you'll only pay that lower price.</p>

<p><a name="buyordersactive"></a></p>

<h3>How many buy orders can I have active?</h3>

<p>You can have up to 10 times your current wallet balance in buy orders active at any time. This is so you can place low-priced buy orders on a lot of items that you're interested in. If you don't have enough money in your Steam Wallet to fulfill a buy order, that buy order will be automatically cancelled.</p>

<p><a name="buyordersview"></a></p>

<h3>How can I see my buy orders?</h3>

<p>You can see the list of all buy orders you have active on the front page of the Steam Community Market - <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/market/" title="Steam Community Market">http://steamcommunity.com/market/</a> . You can cancel any of your active buy orders from here.</p>

<p><a name="buyordersperiod"></a></p>

<h3>How long do buy orders stay active?</h3>

<p>Buy orders may be cancelled by the system at any time including but not limited to the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>if something about the item changes</li>
	<li>if there are any issues with your wallet balance</li>
	<li>if there are issues with trying to complete a purchase</li>
	<li>if something changes about your Steam Account</li>
	<li>if the buy order results in a purchase</li>
</ul>

<p>You can check on the status of your buy orders at any time by visiting <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/market/" title="Steam Community Market">http://steamcommunity.com/market/</a>.</p>

<p><a name="buyordershelp"></a></p>

<h3>How do buy orders help me?</h3>

<p>Buy orders are helpful in making it easier to buy items - since you don't have to choose individual listings, you can choose your price, and you can specify how many of the item you want to buy with each purchase.</p>

<p>Buy orders help with selling, as you can see what other users are willing to pay for an item, and you can choose if you want to do a lower price to sell immediately; or go for a higher price and wait.</p>

<p><a name="buyordersinfo"></a></p>

<h3>How do buy orders choose which listing to buy?</h3>

<p>When you place a buy order, the market first looks for all the cheapest items that can fulfill your order. Then the oldest listing (i.e. the seller who has waited the longest) is selected and purchased. If the items are listed in multiple currencies, the amounts are first converted into your currency before being selected (i.e. a 0.03 RUB listing has no priority over a 0.03 USD listing)</p>

<p><a name="buyordersnewlistings"></a></p>

<h3>If multiple buy orders satisfy a new market listing, which buy order gets processed?</h3>

<p>We have made some changes to how this works in March of 2017, and again in July of 2017 to try to be more fair for users of all currencies.</p>

<p>The oldest matching buy order will be selected. It used to be that the buy order for the highest amount after currency conversion would be selected, but that was unfair to users of some currencies as the maximum amount differs from currency to currency. So now, if multiple buy orders could fulfill a newly-listed item, the oldest buy order will be selected.</p>

<div class="category"><span>Credit Card Verification</span></div>

<p><a name="whatisit"></a></p>

<h3>What is credit card verification?</h3>

<p>Credit card verification allows you to remove market restrictions associated with using a new credit card. After a successful verification, you will regain Market capabilities.</p>

<p><a name="howtoverify"></a></p>

<h3>How do I verify my recently used credit card?</h3>

<p>After using a credit card on Steam to add Wallet funds, please go to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/verifycards">Credit Card Verification page</a> and choose the card you wish to verify. Two pending authorization amounts will be sent to your bank account. These authorizations may take one or two days to appear on your statement. Once they appear, you must enter the exact pre-converted amounts into the two fields on the verification page. Please note that you only have <b>three</b> attempts to input the correct amounts into the verification page.</p>

<p><a name="failattempts"></a></p>

<h3>What happens if I use all three attempts to verify my credit card?</h3>

<p>If you fail to verify the card after three attempts, you will have to wait the normal three day period to use the Community Market. Steam Support cannot override or remove this restriction.</p>

<p><a name="drop"></a></p>

<h3>When will the authorizations be removed from my credit card statement?</h3>

<p>The authorizations will be removed from your credit card statement in 5-10 business days, whether you successfully verified your credit card or not.</p>

<p><a name="conversion"></a></p>

<h3>In what currency do the amounts need to be entered in and how do I get the original pre-converted amounts?</h3>

<p>The verification authorizations are sent to your bank in the currency that your Steam Wallet is in. If the bank converts these to your local currency, you must contact them to request the original amount before any fees assessed by them or conversion made by the bank. The phone number for most banks will be on the back of your credit card.</p>

<p><a name="virtual"></a></p>

<h3>Are virtual online credit cards supported?</h3>

<p>The verification process does not currently support virtual credit cards. You must wait three days to use the Community Market each time you use a virtual card on Steam.</p>

<p><a name="paypal"></a></p>

<h3>What do I do if I used PayPal to fund my Wallet? Can I verify PayPal?</h3>

<p>PayPal cannot be verified through this system. If you fund your Wallet with a PayPal account you will have to wait three days to use the funds on the Community Market.</p>

<p><a name="onecharge"></a></p>

<h3>What do I do if I only see one verification charge?</h3>

<p>You are likely seeing the initial charge which was made to fund your Steam Wallet balance. This is not the verification amount. Your bank may not support our verification system or the charges may not have appeared yet.</p>

<p><a name="banksupport"></a></p>

<h3>What do I do if my bank is unable to help convert or provide the verification charges? Can you help me find them?</h3>

<p>If your bank can't provide or assist you with finding the correct verification amounts you will have to wait three days to use the Community Market. Steam Support cannot assist with verifying the funds or provide you with the verification amounts.</p>

<p><a name="howlong"></a></p>

<h3>Once my credit card has been successfully verified through the verification tool, will I ever trigger this restriction again?</h3>

<p>Once you have successfully verified your credit card through our tool you will never trigger this restriction on your account again unless you use a new unverified payment method or PayPal account to fund your Steam Wallet.</p>

<p><a name="paymentmethods"></a></p>

<h3>Which payment methods will trigger this three day payment restriction?</h3>

<p>Only credit cards and PayPal currently trigger this restriction. We recommend using another payment method to purchase Wallet funds if you do not wish to incur this restriction, especially if you are not able to verify you credit card successfully.</p>

<p><a name="keephittingit"></a></p>

<h3>Why do I keep triggering this three day payment restriction when adding funds to my Wallet?</h3>

<p>This can happen if the credit card you are using has not been verified on your account yet. If you are not able to successfully verify your credit card, we recommend using another payment method to fund your wallet such as Steam Gift Cards/Wallet Codes. You can read more about using them in the <a href="kb_article.php?ref=1122-RTSC-0478" title="Steam Gift Cards">Steam Wallet</a> article.</p>

<p><a name="whatifIwait"></a></p>

<h3>Will my credit card and/or PayPal account become 'verified' once the three day restriction ends?</h3>

<p>No, the only way to verify your credit card is through our <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/verifycards">verification tool</a>. If you do not successfully verify your credit card through this tool you may hit this restriction again in the future.</p>

<p><a name="giftcards"></a></p>

<h3>How do I verify a gift card that has a limited amount of funds?</h3>

<p>In order to complete credit card verification, you'll need between $3 and $4 USD remaining on the card. In 5-10 business days, the money will be returned to the card. If you cannot complete credit card verification yourself, you will have to wait three days until the restriction is removed automatically.</p>
